LXC - DISTROBUILDER
============
Always wished for something like a Dockerfile but for LXC containers -  recently i discovered [distrobuilder](https://linuxcontainers.org/distrobuilder/docs/latest/) â€“ it lets you whip up LXC containers effortlessly using a YAML config. I've wrapped it into Ansible playbook and GitHub Actions setup.
